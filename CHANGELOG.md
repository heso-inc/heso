# Changelog

All notable changes to heso are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Docs: the README **Status** section described the hesojs determinism
  engine swap (ADR 0030) as an upcoming change — it actually shipped in
  `0.3.0`. Reworded to the current state. No code changes.

### Added

- First publish of the Python distribution under its current name
  **`heso-runtime`** on PyPI (`pip install heso-runtime`). The import
  name stays `heso`; the binary and the Node package (`@ixla/heso`) are
  unchanged.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- The JS engine is now built from the in-tree **hesojs** determinism
  fork (a QuickJS-NG fork) instead of stock `rquickjs`'s vendored tree
  (ADR 0030). Determinism is injected at the C layer —
  `JS_SetClockSource` / `JS_SetRandomSource` / `JS_SetRuntimeTimezone`
  replace the JS-side monkey-patches (the `WrappedDate` shim, the
  `Math.random` / `performance.now` closures, and the process-global
  `TZ=UTC` pin). `crypto` is now a pure-JS shim over the seeded engine
  RNG rather than a Rust closure.
- `heso search` no longer queries the DuckDuckGo endpoints by default —
  they `202`/`403`-throttle scripted callers per IP and only added a
  `blocked` row from a normal egress IP. They remain available opt-in
  via `--engines ddg,ddg-lite`. The default pool is now Mojeek + Brave +
  Marginalia + Wikipedia (plus SearXNG when `--searx-url` is set).
- Repository and homepage links updated to `github.com/heso-inc/heso`
  across the Cargo, npm, and PyPI package metadata, the CLI banner, and
  the docs.

### Added

- The README publishes measured macOS arm64 release-binary stats
  (binary size, cold-start latency over the network, and engine-only
  latency).

### Removed

- The `disable-assertions` (`-DNDEBUG`) workaround and the four-step
  `Drop` GC dance. heso now ships with C **assertions ON**: the
  ES2025 iterator-helper shutdown-GC reference cycle that aborted
  `eval-dom` on some pages is fixed at the engine (hesojs F1), with
  `JS_FreeRuntimeForce` as the safety net.

### Fixed

- `eval-dom` no longer aborts tearing down the runtime on pages that
  exercise the iterator-helper shutdown-GC cycle (e.g. astro.build,
  vercel.com).
- First-run signing-identity creation is now atomic: the 32-byte key is
  written to a temp file and hard-linked into place, so concurrent `heso`
  invocations on a fresh machine can no longer observe a half-written key
  and fail with `identity key file ... has wrong length: expected 32,
  got 0`.

> **Note:** `plat_hash` shifts for pages that read the date or RNG.
> Native `Date.toString()` and `Math.random` produce different bytes
> than the old JS shims (determinism still holds: same seed + same
> engine version → identical bytes). Re-stamp cassettes recorded
> against the old engine. Plats over static content (no date/RNG) are
> unaffected and replay byte-identically across the swap.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Scoped the plat performance claims in the docs to what they
  demonstrably prove, and removed the competitor comparison table.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Read and interact against the hydrated (post-script) DOM, and wrapped
  the new CLI flags in the npm and Python libraries with documentation
  for the new capabilities.

### Changed

- Phrased the bare-plat contract in present tense.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-28

### Removed

- The plat registry. The `publish`, `pull`, and `list` verbs and the
  `heso registry` namespace are gone, along with the hosted store at
  `heso.ca/ecosystem`. Sharing a plat now means handing someone the
  file (or a URL to it); they run `heso run -` or `heso verify` against
  it. heso no longer publishes or hosts plats.

### Changed

- `search` now queries Mojeek alongside DuckDuckGo and the Wikipedia
  knowledge block (plus an optional SearXNG endpoint via `--searx-url`
  / `HESO_SEARX_URL`), so results are returned more reliably when one
  backend is unavailable. No API key is required.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- A plat body now records the `seed` it ran under (`FetchPage.seed`,
  default 0), an ordinary field covered by `plat_hash`, so a run is
  self-describingly reproducible (HESO/1.0 §4).
- `heso-verify`: a standalone HESO/1.0 Grade-0 verifier crate that owns
  the canonicalization, `plat_hash`, and sealed-envelope open/verify
  logic with a minimal dependency set (serde, serde_json, serde_jcs,
  blake3, ed25519-dalek verify-only, base64) — no engine, DOM, or
  network crate. The engine's verify path now delegates to it, so the
  open/verify logic lives in exactly one place. The verb surface
  (`heso unseal` / `heso verify`) is unchanged.

### Changed

- `heso run` replays under the seed recorded in the input plat rather
  than a hardcoded 0, so a deterministic replay reproduces the same DOM
  an independent verifier would. An explicit `--seed` still overrides;
  legacy plats with no recorded seed fall back to 0. Replaying an
  unmodified plat stays byte-identical (the stamp → run `plat_hash`
  contract holds).

### Fixed

- The PyPI wheel builds again. setup.py hands the native `heso` binary
  to setuptools as a `scripts` entry; setuptools' `build_scripts`
  command tried to tokenize it as Python and failed the wheel build
  (`source code cannot contain null bytes` on Linux, `invalid or
  missing encoding declaration` on Windows). The binary is now copied
  into the wheel's `*.data/scripts/` directory verbatim. 0.1.8 shipped
  to npm but not PyPI for this reason; 0.1.9 restores PyPI.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- `click` on a non-navigating element (an in-page handler that mutates
  the DOM or calls `history.pushState`) now returns the post-click
  `text`, `tree`, and `content_hash`, so an agent can see what changed.
  The `<a href>` navigation path (which already returned the
  destination's fields) is unchanged.
- `run` gains `--no-verify-input` to skip the input-integrity check
  introduced below.

### Changed

- The `heso` command installed by `pip install heso` is now the native
  Rust binary itself (shipped via the wheel's `*.data/scripts/`
  directory) instead of a Python console-script that booted the
  interpreter before exec'ing the binary. `import heso` and
  `python -m heso` are unchanged.
- `read` no longer fetches external `<script src=...>` by default; pass
  `--js-fetch` to opt in (matching `read --help` and `eval-dom`). Inline
  scripts are unaffected.
- `run` now verifies the input plat's integrity before replaying and
  refuses on a `plat_hash` mismatch (exit 1, `{ok: false, error: {code:
  "plat_integrity_mismatch", ...}}`); a missing or malformed `plat_hash`
  exits 2. `--no-verify-input` restores the prior replay-anything
  behavior. This is a contract change — `run` previously replayed any
  input and exited 0. See ADR 0024.

### Fixed

- `heso read` now accepts `--js-fetch`. The flag was advertised in
  `read --help` but rejected by the argument parser.
- `read` output is internally consistent after JavaScript runs: `tree`,
  `title`, `description`, and `metadata` are derived from the post-JS
  DOM, matching `text` and `actions`. Previously `tree` reflected the
  pre-JS HTML while `text` reflected the post-JS mutated DOM.
- `read`'s `cookies` field now includes cookies set by page JavaScript
  via `document.cookie`, merged with the network `Set-Cookie` headers.
  `batch` and `serve` keep their per-response cookie snapshot.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- `--no-private-networks` flag (and the `HESO_BLOCK_PRIVATE_NETWORKS`
  environment variable) opt into SSRF protection. heso resolves each
  target and refuses the request if any resolved IP is loopback,
  RFC1918 private, link-local (including the `169.254.169.254`
  cloud-metadata address), unspecified, CGNAT (`100.64.0.0/10`), IPv6
  unique-local, or an IPv4-mapped form of any of those. The check runs
  on the resolved address, so an inward-pointing hostname is caught as
  well as a literal IP, and a redirect to a literal private IP is
  refused mid-chain. Off by default so `localhost` stays reachable;
  enable it per call with the flag or process-wide with the env var. A
  blocked request emits `{ok: false, error: {code:
  "private_network_blocked", url}}` and exits 1.
- `--js-timeout <duration>` on `eval-js` and `eval-dom` caps script
  wall-clock time via an interrupt-handler watchdog and returns a
  structured `timeout` error on expiry. Default: no cap.
- `eval-js` / `eval-dom` serialize a DOM-element result as
  `{tag, outerHTML, attrs}` instead of an empty object.

### Changed

- `--best-effort` `partial_reason` gains three values: `bot_challenge`
  now also covers Reddit-style "please wait for verification"
  interstitials; `non_html_content_type` flags a `200 OK` carrying a
  non-HTML body (PDF, JSON, octet-stream, images) instead of treating
  an empty extraction as a clean page; and `http_<code>` reports a
  non-2xx status.
- `eval-js` / `eval-dom` run on a dedicated 8 MB-stack thread, so deep
  recursion trips QuickJS's own guard and returns a structured engine
  error instead of overflowing the OS stack. Serialized eval results
  are capped at 10 MB with a structured error.

### Fixed

- The broken-pipe hook recognizes Windows pipe-closed errors (OS error
  109 / 232) alongside the Unix "Broken pipe" string, so piping a
  verb's output into a reader that closes early (`heso ... | head`)
  exits cleanly on every platform instead of aborting with a panic.
- `verify --trusted-keys` (and `HESO_TRUSTED_KEYS`) fail closed on an
  empty allowlist: zero entries is an error (exit 1), not a
  trust-anyone wildcard.
- Argument errors on the eval and read paths (malformed URL, ASCII
  control characters in a URL, unknown `--include` key, empty search
  query, ref/locator misses) emit a structured `{ok: false, error:
  {code, message}}` envelope on stdout alongside the stderr line. URLs
  containing control characters are rejected rather than silently
  rewritten.
- `stamp` / `run` report an actionable error when a plan action carries
  a CLI-only `--text` / `--selector` / `--aria-label` locator instead
  of a stable `ref`, pointing at `heso find` / `heso read` rather than
  a terse "unknown field" message.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Removed internal project-document references from public surfaces.
  The verify-side stderr ("`mode: live` is not replay-safe ..."), the
  cassette-miss errors emitted by the JS `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest`
  shims, the Python wrapper docstrings, the TypeScript declarations,
  the README, and the CONTRIBUTING notes no longer cite internal
  project documents. User-facing prose now describes the behavior
  directly.
- README's `heso run` description drops the parenthetical project-doc
  citation; receipts example no longer trails "per <internal-doc>" on
  the live-mode rejection.
- Hygiene: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and the hygiene workflow's `.md`
  allowlist now admit the four standard meta files
  (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`). The old `readme-sync-blocks` job (which assumed
  `npm/heso/README.md` lived in the git tree) is replaced with a
  positive assertion that `.github/workflows/pypi.yml` carries the
  publish-time `cp README.md npm/heso/README.md` step. Drift between
  the GitHub-displayed README and the npm-displayed README is now
  structurally impossible — the file is generated at publish time
  from the same root README.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Global `--timeout <duration>` flag on every network-touching verb
  (`open`, `read`, `click`, `fill`, `submit`, `eval-dom`, `batch`,
  `stamp`, `refresh`, `meta`, `find`, `tree`, `ls`, `cat`). Defaults to
  30 seconds. On timeout the verb emits a structured envelope
  `{ok: false, error: {code: "timeout", timeout_ms, elapsed_ms, url}}`
  and exits 1. `--timeout 0` opts out. The Python and Node wrappers
  install a `timeout + 5s` process-kill backstop.
- Click responses now include `final_url` (where the navigation
  actually landed after following the destination's redirect chain)
  and `redirects[]` (a `{from, to, status}` chain) alongside the
  existing `navigated` / `navigated_to` fields.
- Click, fill, and submit responses now share a unified writing-verb
  envelope: `{ok, op, url, ref, selector, element_id, value, result,
  console, error}`. Selector misses surface as `ok: false` with
  `error.code: "selector_not_matched"`.
- `stamp` step entries carry per-step `status`, `observed` payload,
  and logical `started_at` / `finished_at` timestamps in addition to
  the existing `verb` / `action` / `url_before` / `url_after` fields.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and this
  changelog at the repo root.

### Changed

- `heso search <query>` is a top-level verb again. The
  `heso registry search ...` form continues to work as the
  registry-namespace alias.
- README rewritten to lead with `eval-dom`, drop the manifest tone,
  and name the verified medium-tier WAF pass-throughs (Zillow,
  Walmart, CoinGecko, LinkedIn anonymous, TripAdvisor, Yahoo Finance,
  old.reddit). The status note now scopes `bot_challenge` honestly to
  the nine WAF needles plus `__cf_chl_opt`.
- npm package README is sourced from the root `README.md` at publish
  time by `scripts/deploy.ps1` and `.github/workflows/pypi.yml`, so
  the GitHub homepage and the npm package can no longer drift
  independently. Stale `unpack` / `plat-*` blocks gone.
- `spec/HESO-1.0.md` is now a thin pointer; the canonical spec lives
  at <https://heso.ca/spec>.
- `heso --help` banner rewritten to match the current dispatch —
  removed stale entries for verbs that were collapsed into the
  polymorphic surface or moved under `heso registry`, and removed
  footer links to internal project documents that aren't part of the
  public repo.
- Engine: response bodies are capped before DOM parsing
  (`engine-js`), and registry / Wikipedia / SearXNG responses are
  capped at 4–16 MiB each.
- Engine: `cli` enforces a wall-clock cap on `open` and `read`.
- `serve`: live-pages store bounded at 32 entries.
- Trace / primitives: `Action` and `PrimitiveOp` inputs now reject
  unknown fields rather than silently dropping them.

### Fixed

- `is_bot_challenge` runs before the HTTP-status branch in
  `partial_reason_for_status`, so Cloudflare / Imperva interstitials
  surface as `partial_reason: "bot_challenge"` regardless of the
  wrapper status (200 / 403 / 429 / 503).
- Ecosystem `pull` now verifies the downloaded plat's BLAKE3 hash
  against the requested content address.
- Module docstring and `cmd_replay` stderr in
  `crates/heso-cli/src/main.rs` no longer reference removed verbs or
  internal-only docs.
- README no longer links to internal project files that aren't
  checked in publicly.
- `SealOptions.tsa` and `SealOptions.noResign` removed from the npm
  TypeScript types (they were declared but never wired through the
  CLI). The Python `seal` docstring drops the same unimplemented
  flags.
- Python wrappers document the `timeout` kwarg on `click`, `fill`,
  `submit`, `meta`, `ls`, `cat`, `find`, `tree`, and `refresh` — the
  flag has worked since the global `--timeout` landed but was missing
  from the docstrings.
- Duplicate `Some("search")` dispatch arm in `crates/heso-cli/src/main.rs`
  removed (the second occurrence was unreachable).
