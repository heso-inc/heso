//! # heso-engine-fetch
//!
//! The static path of heso — the agent-native web engine. No Chromium. No
//! Node. One Rust binary. Native HTTP + HTML implementation of
//! [`heso_engine_api::EngineApi`]: `reqwest` + `scraper`, deploys
//! anywhere `heso.exe` runs.
//!
//! Per [ADR 0012], this is the static engine. Per [ADR 0014], the JS engine
//! lives in the sibling crate [`heso-engine-js`](../heso_engine_js/index.html)
//! (QuickJS via `rquickjs`, Phase 1A landed). Together they cover the
//! in-scope half from [ADR 0016] — fetch, parse, JS, DOM (Phase 1B),
//! forms, clicks, sessions — and explicitly drop the rendering half
//! (canvas, WebGL, video, CSS layout).
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! - HTTP fetch via [`reqwest`] (`rustls` TLS, gzip/brotli, HTTP/2, follows
//!   up to 20 redirects).
//! - HTML parse via [`scraper`] (which uses Servo's `html5ever`).
//! - Visible-text extraction, walking the DOM and skipping
//!   `<script>` / `<style>` / `<noscript>` / `<template>` subtrees.
//! - Captures the post-redirect final URL on the [`FetchPage`] so
//!   `Page::url()` returns the URL the agent actually landed on.
//!
//! ## What it does not do
//!
//! - **No JavaScript on this path.** SPAs that need JS to populate the DOM
//!   will look empty here. Use the sibling JS engine for those (Phase 1B
//!   wires the DOM, Phase 1C runs `<script>` on load).
//! - **No CSS layout.** We extract semantic structure (HTML/ARIA), not
//!   visual position. That's the bet — see [ADR 0016].
//! - **No form submission with JS validation.** Plain `<form>` POSTs are
//!   possible later via the same `reqwest::Client`; JS-validated forms
//!   need the JS engine wired through.
//!
//! For the majority of read-only agent tasks (docs, news, blogs, marketing
//! sites, listings, simple e-commerce), this is enough — and the unique
//! heso value (signed receipts, content-addressed pages, terminal-shell
//! primitive vocabulary, deterministic replay) all works on top of it.
//!
//! ## Why this beats "reqwest + scraper in agent's own code"
//!
//! - **Stable element refs across snapshots** — future primitives (`find`,
//!   `cat @e3`) will assign deterministic `@e0/@e1/...` refs at parse time
//!   so a planner-emitted trace can name an element on one fetch and still
//!   refer to it on the next.
//! - **AX-tree-shaped representation** (planned) — derive semantic
//!   structure from ARIA + HTML5 tags so the agent sees a tree of
//!   `(role, name, ref)` instead of raw DOM nodes.
//! - **Signed deterministic receipts** — every `heso run` produces a
//!   `Receipt` with a BLAKE3 `trace_hash`. Static fetches are deterministic
//!   by construction (no clock, no RNG); the receipt is replayable
//!   anywhere given the same URL + recorded network bytes.
//! - **One agent contract** — `heso.run(start_url, request)`. Plain
//!   English in, signed structured data out. No CSS selectors, no XPath.
