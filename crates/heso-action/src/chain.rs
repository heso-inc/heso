//! Cross-receipt chaining — tamper-evident ordering over a session of
//! [`ActionReceipt`]s.
//!
//! A single [`ActionReceipt`] proves *one* action happened under policy. A
//! chain proves a *sequence* happened in a specific order with nothing dropped,
//! reordered, or inserted between links. The chain block lives in the SIGNED
//! content ([`ActionContent::session_id`] / [`ActionContent::seq`] /
//! [`ActionContent::prev_receipt_hash`]), so an operator cannot re-point a
//! receipt at a different predecessor without breaking its own operator
//! signature.
//!
//! ## The link
//!
//! Each non-genesis receipt carries `prev_receipt_hash = link_hash(prev)`, the
//! BLAKE3 of the previous receipt's domain-separated, **length-prefixed**
//! [`link_input`]. Genesis (`seq == 0`) carries no `prev_receipt_hash`
//! (`None`/empty).
//!
//! ### Why length-prefixed
//!
//! The link input commits to three byte strings: `session_id`, `seq` (LE u64),
//! and `action_hash`. If they were concatenated raw, an attacker could move
//! bytes across the `session_id` / `action_hash` boundary
//! (`"sess" ++ "abc…"` vs `"se" ++ "ssabc…"`) and forge a colliding link to
//! splice a different receipt into the order. Each field is therefore prefixed
//! with its byte length as a LE u64 ([`push_field`]), under the
//! [`RECEIPT_CHAIN_DOMAIN`] separator — so the link digest is an unambiguous,
//! collision-resistant commitment to *(session, position, content)* and the
//! order it implies cannot be forged by field-boundary sliding.
//!
//! ## The verdict
//!
//! [`verify_action_receipt_chain`] runs the full per-receipt offline check
//! ([`crate::verify::open_receipt`]: alg, version, content hash, signatures,
//! redaction, trust level) on every link AND the inter-link invariants, and
//! NAMES the failure:
//!
//! - [`ChainOutcome::ContentTamper`] — a receipt's own crypto failed (its
//!   content/signature does not verify); carries the offending `seq` and the
//!   underlying [`ActionOutcome`].
//! - [`ChainOutcome::LinkBroken`] — every receipt is internally valid, but the
//!   ordering is wrong: a bad genesis, a `seq` gap/repeat/regression (a
//!   **drop**/**reorder**/**insert**), a `session_id` that changes mid-chain, or
//!   a `prev_receipt_hash` that does not equal the recomputed link of the actual
//!   predecessor.
//!
//! Fail-closed: an empty slice is [`ChainOutcome::Empty`], not `Valid`.
