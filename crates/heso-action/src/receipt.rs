//! The frozen ActionReceipt data types and content hashing.
//!
//! An [`ActionReceipt`] is the signed, offline-verifiable record of a single
//! agent action — an LLM call, a tool call, a payment, an account change, …. It
//! is a signed envelope, structurally modeled on the witness notary's
//! `WitnessReceipt` (and, transitively, on [`heso_verify::SealedPlat`]): `alg` +
//! `content` + `signatures` + an out-of-content `transparency` slot. Its self-
//! hash field is named `action_hash` (not `plat_hash` / `witness_hash`) and it
//! signs under its own domain ([`crate::domain::ACTION_SIGNING_DOMAIN`]) so the
//! three formats can never be confused.
//!
//! These types are **pure data** — no crypto lives here (mirroring how the
//! witness notary's receipt types are separate from its signer). The only logic
//! is [`action_canonical_bytes`] / [`action_content_hash`], which define the
//! exact bytes that get hashed and signed.
//!
//! ## Two signatures over one canonical body
//!
//! [`ActionReceipt::signatures`] is an **array**. v1.0 carries the operator's
//! authorization (`key_id = "operator"`) and — only when the action was gated to
//! `RequireApproval` — a single human approver's co-signature
//! (`key_id = "approver"`). Both cover the *same* `action_canonical_bytes`, but
//! under distinct domains ([`crate::domain::ACTION_SIGNING_DOMAIN`] vs
//! [`crate::domain::APPROVAL_SIGNING_DOMAIN`]) so an operator authorization can
//! never be replayed as an approver decision. The verifier RE-DERIVES the trust
//! level from which role tags actually carry a valid signature; the embedded
//! [`ActionContent::trust_level`] is for display and is NOT trusted.
//!
//! ## Reserved slots (absent on the wire)
//!
//! Every forward-compat slot uses `skip_serializing_if`, so a v1.0 receipt
//! serializes identically whether or not the field is present-but-empty —
//! reserving them now changes no signed bytes:
//!
//! - `transparency` (`Vec`, skipped when empty) — transparency-log inclusion
//!   proofs. Lives **outside** `content`, so a proof can be attached to an
//!   already-signed receipt without re-signing.
//! - `content.approver_decision` (`Option`) — present only on a gated action.
//! - `content.redaction` (`Option`) — present only when a field was redacted.
//! - `content.action.result_hash` / `error` / `target_host` (`Option`).
//! - `content.session_id` / `seq` / `prev_receipt_hash` (`Option`) — the v2
//!   cross-receipt chain block; present together on a chained receipt, all
//!   absent on a standalone one.
//! - reserved `content.nonce` / `attestation` (`Option`).
//! - `content.time_anchor` (`Option`) — the v2 RFC-3161 trusted-time anchor;
//!   present only when a TSA token was obtained, verified fail-closed when it is.
